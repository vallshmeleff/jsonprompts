Let's prepare a training exercise using the Oflameron WORDS method for learning English. To do this, we'll select 15 English words on the topic "Spending a whole day in Berlin exploring the city" and process each of them using the following algorithm:

1. Transform the words into one-dimensional matrices (rows) whose elements are the letters of the original words (i.e., divide the word into letters). This will be the original matrix.

2. Randomly re-sort the elements of each matrix (use only one sorting option for each word). This will be the target matrix.

3. Create a special word (special word) from the re-sorted one-dimensional matrix as follows: sequentially select elements from the re-sorted matrix and write them in a row without spaces to form the special word.

4. Remember the original English words and their corresponding special words for future use, and calculate and remember the number of characters in them.

Write an exercise in English on the topic "Spending a whole day in Berlin exploring the city." Use the original English words in the text, but replace them with the corresponding specialized words you've prepared.

Display only the final result—the completed text in English.

Notes:
Oflameron WORDS - a method for effectively learning foreign languages ​​using AI. The method was developed by Valery Shmelev in 1994. With the development of AI, it has come to be used to generate learning exercises.
The Oflameron WORDS method asks students to read a text in the target language. In the text, some words are replaced with special words (special words). In these words, all the letters are randomly rearranged. The number of letters and the set of letters in the special words strictly correspond to the original word.
